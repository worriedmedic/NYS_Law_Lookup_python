All URIs listed in these docs are relative to the Open Legislation subdomain:legislation.nysenate.gov

To make an API request using your key, set the key string as the value of the ‘key’ request parameter in the request URL.

For example, if you wanted to get data for bill S1 of the 2015 session, your request would look something like this: legislation.nysenate.gov/api/3/bills/2015/S1?key=*your key goes here*

In order to utilize the Laws API we’ll go over some quick terminology:

Law Id: A three letter code that identifies the law, e.g. EDN for Education Law.

Document Id: A string that identifies a particular document within a body of law. Contains the three letter law id so it can uniquely identify a document.

Location Id; This is simply the document id without the three letter law id prefix.

Published Date: Since the nature of laws are fairly temporal we keep track of changes to the laws using the published date. It’s possible to retrieve law documents roughly as they were represented during any week since October 2014.

Get a law sub document

Usage

(GET) /api/3/laws/{lawId}/{locationId}

The lawId once again is the three letter code (e.g. EDN, TAX) and locationId is the identifier for the sub document. You can discover the locationId when you make an API request for the law structure (see above section). See the ‘locationId’ field for that response.

Examples

/api/3/laws/TAX/8/     // Get section 8 of Tax law
/api/3/laws/EDN/A2/    // Get article 2 of Education law
